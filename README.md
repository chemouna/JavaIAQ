Inspired by Peter Norvig blog post [](http://norvig.com/java-iaq.html) and Java 
Puzzlers book, this is an attempt to expand more of it and put the subtle parts of java that i encounter here.

## Can overridden methods differ in return type ?
- An overridden method may have a more specific return type. That is, as long as the new return type is 
  assignable to the return type of the method you are overriding, it's allowed.
